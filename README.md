# Pong-Game
A pong game made by me in Python 3 using turtle module.I made this short beginners project to improve my knowledge of python.
I followed the video tutorial given on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8WgrUWG_I&list=PLlEgNdBJEO-kXk2PyBxhSmo84hsO3HAz2&index=1.
I used the Visual Studio Code or VSCode for development. I developed this on the Linux platform namely Ubuntu 18.04.
